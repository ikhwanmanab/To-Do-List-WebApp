# To-Do-List-WebApp
HTML: The structure includes a header displaying the current date and time, an input field for new tasks, a task list, and a footer with a "Clear Completed" button and task count. A "Select All" checkbox is included to mark all tasks as completed or uncompleted.

CSS: The design uses soft colors and rounded elements to achieve a girly, modern look. The task list items have an "Edit" and "Del" button, styled with Bootstrap icons.

JavaScript:

The script handles adding tasks, editing tasks, deleting tasks, selecting all tasks, and clearing completed tasks.
The current date and time are displayed and updated every minute.
The task count updates automatically as tasks are added, completed, or removed.
This code should give you a To-Do List App that looks very similar to the design in the image you provided. You can further customize the colors, fonts, and icons to match your preferences!
